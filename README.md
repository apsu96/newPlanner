**Planner** is a minimalistic app that helps users to organize their days and improve work-life balance. 

While planning users can add tasks, expected duration and the category of the tasks (i.e "work" or "leisure") into the app. 

As a result, the app will indicate allocation of users' time between work and leisure. 

Performing tasks users are free to use stopwatch and mark their emotional state.

The app also provides statistics on users' tasks performance and emotional state.
